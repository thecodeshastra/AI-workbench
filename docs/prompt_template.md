## Basic prompt structure
```
[ROLE]: Act as [specific role/expert]
[CONTEXT]: In the context of [situation/background]
[TASK/INSTRUCTION]: [Specific action or output desired]
[FORMAT/NOTES]: Present this as [specific structure]
[TONE]: Using a [specific style/voice]
```

## CLEAR framework
```
C - Context: Provide relevant background information
L - Length: Specify desired output length
E - Examples: Show what good output looks like
A - Audience: Define who the output is for
R - Role: Assign a specific persona or expertise to the AI
```

## Problem-Solution-Benefit structure
```
PROBLEM: [Clearly define what needs to be solved]
CONTEXT: [Provide relevant background and constraints]
SOLUTION REQUEST: [Specify what type of solution you need]
BENEFIT FOCUS: [What outcomes are most important]
FORMAT: [How you want the response structured]
```

## Audience-Purpose-Action structure
```
AUDIENCE: [Who will use this information]
PURPOSE: [Why they need it]
ACTION: [What they should be able to do with it]
CONSTRAINTS: [Any limitations or requirements]
SUCCESS CRITERIA: [How to measure if it's working]
```

## Core principles 
- Be **CLEAR & SPECIFIC**:
    - Clear: State exactly what you need.
    - Specific: Use precise words, define terms, set boundaries (what NOT to do).
    - *Be explicit, Avoid ambiguity, define terms, set boundaries
- Provide **CONTEXT**:
    - Background: Give relevant details for the situation.
    - Audience: Who is this for? (e.g., a beginner, your boss).
    - Purpose: Why do you need this?
    - Constraint communication: share limitations or requirements
- **STRUCTURE & ORGANIZE**:
    - Flow: Present info logically.
    - Format: Use lists, headings, or show examples.
    - Prioritization: put the most important information first
    - Examples: show what good output looks like

## Prompt Libraries and Documentation:

### Building Your Prompt Library:
- Category Organization: Group prompts by use case or industry
- Template Creation: Develop reusable prompt templates
- Performance Tracking: Note which prompts work best for what purposes
- Version Control: Keep track of prompt iterations and improvements
- Sharing: Document effective prompts for team use

### Template Example:
```
PROMPT TEMPLATE: Competitive Analysis
PURPOSE: Generate structured competitor analysis
VARIABLES: [Company Name], [Industry], [Specific Features to Compare]
STRUCTURE:
- Act as [Role]
- Analyze [Company] in [Industry]
- Focus on [Specific Areas]
- Present as [Format]
